## How to work with tasks
1. Make sure, that `definition of done` is completed. 
2. Remove not needed code, make clean up. 
3. Add some tests, which verify your new code. 
4. Create a PR with link to issue, which you want to solve. 
5. If you don't get a response in your PR for 2 days, ping maintainers explicitly.
